## Learning How to Bet
In order to prevent clogging and chaos, here is [a link to a pastebin containing every sportsbook faq's/how to bet](http://pastebin.com/J4HkjbRi)

### What is a Unit?
A unit is a certain % of your bankroll. If you want to go risk-it-for-the-biscuit, 5% per unit would be a risky measurement. 2.5% is a recommended amount, and if your bankroll is over $1000, 1% would be a good size

### Odds
Many sportsbooks will offer different odds in many different forms.
The most popular is the American Odds. A positive number would mean if you were to bet $100, would you recieve this amount. (For example, if you see the odds of +150, if you were to bet $100 you would receive $150 in winnings)
When you see a negative number, that would mean you would have to bet that amount of money to earn $100. (For example, if you saw -130, then you would have to wager $130 in order to earn $100 in winnings)

The 2nd most popular form of odds is the decimal odd. In this case, you would take your wager amount, multiply it by the odds, and then subtract that amount by the wager. (For example, you bet $100 on a game with 1.9 odds. You take 100 * 1.9 which would equal $190. You would then subtract $190-$100, and you would have $90 in winnings)
